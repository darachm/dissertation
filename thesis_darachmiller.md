> "Science is a match that man has just got alight. He thought he 
> was in a room &#8212; in moments of devotion, a temple &#8212; and 
> that his light would be reflected from and display walls inscribed 
> with wonderful secrets and pillars carved with philosophical 
> systems wrought into harmony. 
> 
> It is a curious sensation, now that the preliminary splutter is 
> over and the flame burns up clear, to see his hands lit and just 
> a glimpse of himself and the patch he stands on visible, and 
> around him, in place of all that human comfort and beauty he 
> anticipated, darkness still.

> - H.G. Wells, 1891
