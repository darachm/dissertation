It is a curious sensation, now that the preliminary splutter is

anticipated, \vspace{0.5em} darkness still."

The aim of sailing is to juxtapose a variety of forces against 
each other such that they have no other option than to cause progress.
Without the right constraints and re-direction the system is a 
mess, and destined for the rocks.
Without a good keel there's little for the winds to push off of,
without sails there's little action, and a tiller's important for
deciding where the action should proceed.
When all the components align with and against each
other harmoniously, then the effect is made. 
A rope does not sail upwind, but depends on the cleats, pulleys,
mast, hull, and so forth.

Many human endeavors can be described with 
this metaphor --- a variety of forces, pressures, opportunities, 
all swirling around to make something flow in a particular
direction. 
Here, I acknowledge some of the people that have 
made my progress possible.

The culture built over these many years at NYU Biology is a unique 
moment of growth, and the informal networks of instinctive support
have been essential.
As Benjy Neymotin pointed out several years ago: "it takes a village".

Specifically,
I thank the kind folks on the 4th floor of CGSB, namely
the research group led by Christine Vogel. I am glad we moved to share
space and scientific discussions, and I owe much inspiration to the 
compassionate leadership that Professor Vogel consistently 
demonstrates. As well as introducing me to Michi and the
Tobis-Pedrazas.
I also thank Ken Birnbaum and his group for helpful conversations and
access to the lucky FISH incubator, and Edo Kussell and his group
for equipment and discussions.
The GenCore, led by Tara Rock, has be a valuable help with labor
and guidance from Nicholas Rouillard, Mohammed Khalfan, Pui-Leng Ip,
Gina Viavattene, and Theresa Ten Eyck.
Across the street, I thank Viji Subramanian, Andreas Hochwagen, 
and his research group for microscope access and tolerating my
questions.
Also, Tovah Markowitz for making important research progress
several years ago.
I thank Andres Mansisidor and Matt Paul for helpful reading and 
comments on the paper, and other help.
Additionally, Nick DelRose, Anna Houshangi, Kostya Tchourine
for comradery, support, and walking me out of Langone.

Away from NYU, I thank
Evelina Tutucci for demonstrating the mRNA FISH method to me,
helping me understand just how finicky it can be.
I thank Megan McClean for openly sharing a FISH protocol on
OpenWetWare (although we've never talked).
On the west coast (and now elsewhere) I thank Carole Hom, Ian Korf, 
and Patrice Kohel at UC Davis (in 2012), 
Nitin Baliga Aaron Brooks at ISB Seattle (in 2011), 
but most importantly Marc Facciotti at UC Davis for 
giving me a chance at getting into science late.



I thank staff at eBioscience/Affymetrix/ThermoFisher for support with
the Quantigene/FlowRNA probe set and patience through the years.

I thank the Cold Spring Harbor Yeast Course, especially the instructors
Maitreya Dunham, Marc Gartenberg, and Grant Brown for introducing
me to the community and (re)-lighting a fire to help me finish.
That course is the reason I'm staying in science as long as I can.

I thank past students including Daniel, Alex, and Stephen.

My committee for the most fun three hours I had each year.

Past and present members of the Gresham and Vogel labs for 
discussions and support.
Especially Niki, Steff, Nathan, and Benjy; Naomi, Farah, Siyu,
Pieter.

To Rodoniki Athansidou for steeling me against the alluring
and corrupting temptation of Kits, and Terrance Cooper for sharing
with me the wisdom of when Kits are necessary for a field to
progress. Threading the gradient between these two extremes seems to
contain some degree of powerful wisdom, something about life and
practice and cargo cults and the very nature of scientific
investigations and Darwinian versus Lamarkian biology, but I have 
not yet had the time to condense it into a sharable form (or a Kit).

I thank Michi, Henri(ci), and Tai for making me get up on time,
and come home on time.

I thank Sue Miller for devising a clever genetic screen for yeast
strains that fail to re-initiate growth programs, as well as for
being so supportive through the years.
I also thank my Kendra Miller for inspiring and egging me on, 
a knowingly efficacious combination of support for folks like me.
I thank Harry Miller for support and inspiring me to wander this way,
and to never stop learning new things.

I want to thank Sarah Nguyen for keeping me together, like

\section*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\numberline{}Abstract}
\vspace{-0.5em}

Cellular responses to changing environments frequently involve rapid
transcriptome reprogramming, and regulated changes in mRNA 
degradation rates can accelerate this process.
Upon the addition of glutamine to budding yeast 
(\textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}) limited for nitrogen,
yeast cells resume rapid growth. 
Preceding the changes in population growth rate,
the transcriptome quickly reprograms through a state transiently 
distinct from either rapid or slow growth.
As part of this,
the five fastest decreasing mRNA are all 
\underline{N}itrogen \underline{C}atabolite \underline{R}epression 
(\underline{NCR})-regulated transporters, decreasing 
significantly faster than expected from their mRNA 
stability measured in nitrogen-replete conditions.
I determined the stability of the yeast transcriptome 
preceding and during a nitrogen upshift using 
4-thiouracil labeling and found that 78 mRNAs are destabilized,
a set enriched for NCR and carbon metabolism mRNAs.
To find factors specifying or effecting the destabilization, I
developed a novel method combining mRNA FISH, fluorescence-activated
cell sorting, and DNA barcode sequencing to screen the pooled deletion
collection library for \textit{trans} factors that mediate 
rapid \textit{GAP1} mRNA repression. 
%
%This required that I redesign the methods for 
%low-input multiplexed barcode sequencing, as well as adapt 
%branched-DNA single-molecule mRNA FISH protocols to work in budding
%yeast. 
%
Modeling of the data identifies known factors of mRNA
degradation, namely all three tested components of the
Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex, as being important for wild-type \textit{GAP1}
mRNA levels and dynamics. Deletions of the modulators \textit{EDC3} and \textit{SCD6}
have more complex phenotypes including reduced clearance of
\textit{GAP1}. Re-analyzing previously collected data,
I identified that a \textit{scd6}$\Delta$, \textit{tif4632}$\Delta$
(eIF4G2 delete), and a \textit{GAP1} 5' UTR delete strain all
share a similar phenotype of lower \textit{GAP1} expression preceding
the upshift, and reduced decay upon the upshift. This suggests a
connection between translation initiation and mRNA level in different
environments of nitrogen availability, and that the destabilization 
phenomenon may in fact be the release of a stabilizing effect on these 
mRNA during growth in nitrogen limitation.
