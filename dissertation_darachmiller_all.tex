%\begin{quote}
%\SingleSpace
%"Science is a match that man has just got alight. He thought he 
%was in a room --- in moments of devotion, a temple --- and 
%that his light would be reflected from and display walls inscribed 
%with wonderful secrets and pillars carved with philosophical 
%systems wrought into harmony. 
%\vfill
%It is a curious sensation, now that the preliminary splutter is 
%over and the flame burns up clear, to see his hands lit and just 
%a glimpse of himself and the patch he stands on visible, and 
%around him, in place of all that human comfort and beauty he 
%anticipated, darkness still."
%
%\hfill - H.G. Wells, 1891
