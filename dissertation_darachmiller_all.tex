"Science is a match that a person has just got alight.

in moments of devotion, a temple --- 
and that this light would be reflected from and display walls 
inscribed with wonderful secrets and pillars carved with 
philosophical systems wrought into harmony.

It is a curious sensation, now that the preliminary splutter is 
over and the flame burns up clear, to see lit just their hands and 
just a glimpse of themselves and the patch they stand on visible, and 
around them, in place of all that comfort and beauty they
anticipated, \vspace{0.5em} darkness still."

Sailing works to juxtapose a variety of forces against 
each other such that they have no other option than to cause progress.
Without sails there's no push, without a keel there's nothing to push
off of, and a tiller's important for deciding where the push is to 
proceed.
Without the right constraints and re-direction the system is a 
mess, and destined for the rocks.
%The components must align with and against each
%other harmoniously to make the desired effect.
A rope does not sail upwind but depends on the cleats, pulleys,
mast, hull, and so on.
Many human endeavors can be described with 
this metaphor, with a variety of forces, pressures, and opportunities 
balancing to make progress.
Here, I acknowledge some of the people that have 
made my progress here possible.

The culture built over these many years at NYU Biology has been
important for me completing this work. 
As Benjy Neymotin pointed out several years ago: "it takes a village",
and here one continues to grow.
Specifically,
I thank the kind folks in CGSB, especially our neighbors in
the research group lead by Christine Vogel on the 4th floor.
We've shared
space and scientific discussions, and I owe much inspiration to the 
compassionate leadership that Professor Vogel consistently 
demonstrates (as well as for introducing me to Michi and the
Tobraza's).
I also thank Ken Birnbaum and his group for helpful conversations and
access to the lucky FISH incubator, and Edo Kussell and his group
for equipment and discussions.
The GenCore, led by Tara Rock, has been valuable with labor
and guidance from Nicholas Rouillard, Mohammed Khalfan, Pui-Leng Ip,
Gina Viavattene, and Theresa Ten Eyck.
Across the street in Brown, I thank Viji Subramanian, 
Andreas Hochwagen, and his research group for microscope use 
and tolerating my questions.
Also, Tovah Markowitz for making important research progress
several years ago.
I thank Andres Mansisidor and Matt Paul for helpful reading and 
comments on the paper, and other help.
Additionally, I thank Nick DelRose, Anna Houshangi, Kostya Tchourine
for comradery, support, and walking me out of Langone.

I must also thank Sherry Scott and the rest of the administrative
staff for running this department and making sure the academics
are taken care of, feed, and able to do what they do. These
folks, and the thousands of workers who do the work of the
power and utilities, safe structures and equipment, 
public safety, and logistics that are required to operate any
institution but especially a research university, these folks
make NYU possible in a fundamental way.

Away from NYU, I thank
Evelina Tutucci for demonstrating the mRNA FISH method to me,
helping me understand just how finicky it can be.
I thank Megan McClean for openly sharing a FISH protocol on
OpenWetWare (although we've never spoken).
I thank the Cold Spring Harbor Yeast Course, especially the instructors
Maitreya Dunham, Marc Gartenberg, and Grant Brown for introducing
me to the community and (re)-lighting a fire to help me finish.
The experience of that course is one large reason I'm staying in 
science as long as I can.

From the west coast, I thank Carole Hom, Ian Korf, 
and Patrice Kohel at UC Davis (in 2012), 
Nitin Baliga and Aaron Brooks at ISB Seattle (in 2011), 
Richard Bonneau (NYU, but I meet him at ISB in Seattle),
but most importantly Marc Facciotti at UC Davis for 
giving me a chance at getting into science late.
It's amazing the string of opportunities that have been generously
extended to me, and lead me to this point.

I thank my committee (Edo Kussell, Saeed Tavazoie, Christine Vogel,
and Lionel Christiaen) for the most fun three hours I had each year
for the last couple years.

I thank my mentor and advisor David Gresham for his steadfast
support. His vision and daring has been essential to push this 
project through to completion. I also thank him for putting together
a great group of people, and I thank past and present members of 
his laboratory at NYU for their discussions and support.
Namely, Niki Athanasiadou, Naomi Ziv, 
Benjy Neymotin, Stephanie Lauer, Farah Abdul-Rahman, Siyu Sun,
Grace Avecilla, Pieter Spealman, Chris Jackson,
and especially Nathan Brandt.
I am also thankful to past students including Daniel Pham, 
Alex Ferrena, and Stephen Nyarko. Teaching and learning are essential
for establishing the "Ignorance Gradient" that powers science, and it
is hard to imagine efficient progress without 
someone seeking to learn what has been learned.

%I am thankful for illuminating discussions with various un-named
%persons on a variety of topics. For an example, I will name two:
%I thank Rodoniki Athansidou for steeling me against the alluring
%and corrupting temptation of Just Using Kits, 
%and Terrance Cooper for sharing
%with me the wisdom of when Kits are necessary for a field to
%progress. Threading the two statements might say something about 
%life and practice and cargo cults and the very nature of scientific
%investigations, but I have 
%not yet had the time to condense it into a sharable form 
%(or Kit, if you will).

I thank Michi, Tai, and Henrici "Henri" Poincar\'{e} 
for getting me get up on time.

I thank Sarah Nguyen for keeping me together to complete the journey.
We orbited each other at distance for too long, 
but the wait has been worth it.
I am so very lucky to have meet another soul who shares the same
fundamental interests in understanding and organizing the world so
that others may see clearly and be cared for. I do not know if I
would still be on this path had Sarah not been there to keep me
moving forward, but I know that we are now together and I hope that
I can have a chance to help Sarah along her path as well.

I thank my mother Sue Miller for devising a clever genetic screen 
for yeast strains that fail to re-initiate growth programs, 
as well as for being so unconditionally supportive through the years 
long before and during this work.
I also thank my sister Kendra Miller for inspiring and egging me on, 
a knowingly efficacious combination of support for folks like me.
I thank my father Harry Miller for winding me up to wander, 
and pushing me to keep looking until something worked for me. 
In this, he taught me on a fundamental level
to never stop learning new things. 
I do not think my family knew this outcome was possible, 
but they trusted that I would find something good if I kept looking. 
This trio is responsible for the zealous tenacity, the Long Game, 
the hopes and dreams of what we can learn
and be and do. 

This happened because these many people, and many others, 
made it happen. Part of those who made it happen are those who may
read or use this work. You, the reader, are part of this work,
I thank you for it, 
and I hope that it helps you do what you need to do.
If you have questions, you can always contact the author for 
clarification or discussion.

Cellular responses to changing environments frequently involve rapid
transcriptome reprogramming, and regulated changes in mRNA 
degradation rates can accelerate this process.
Upon the addition of glutamine to budding yeast 
(\textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}) limited for nitrogen,
yeast cells resume rapid growth. 
Preceding the changes in population growth rate,
the transcriptome quickly reprograms through a transition state
distinct from either rapid or slow growth.
As part of this,
the five fastest decreasing mRNA are all 
\underline{N}itrogen \underline{C}atabolite \underline{R}epression 
(\underline{NCR})-regulated transporters, decreasing 
significantly faster than expected from their mRNA 
stability measured in nitrogen-replete conditions.
I determined the stability of the yeast transcriptome 
preceding and during a nitrogen upshift using 
4-thiouracil labeling and found that 78 mRNAs are destabilized,
a set enriched for NCR and carbon metabolism mRNAs.
To find factors specifying or effecting the destabilization, I
developed a novel method combining mRNA FISH, fluorescence-activated
cell sorting, and DNA barcode sequencing to screen the pooled deletion
collection library for \textit{trans} factors that mediate 
rapid \textit{GAP1} mRNA repression. 
%
%This required that I redesign the methods for 
%low-input multiplexed barcode sequencing, as well as adapt 
%branched-DNA single-molecule mRNA FISH protocols to work in budding
%yeast. 
%
Modeling of the data identifies known factors of mRNA
degradation, namely all three tested components of the
Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex, as being important for wild-type \textit{GAP1}
mRNA levels and dynamics. Deletions of the modulators \textit{EDC3} and \textit{SCD6}
have more complex phenotypes including reduced clearance of
\textit{GAP1}. Re-analyzing previously collected data,
I identified that a \textit{scd6}$\Delta$, \textit{tif4632}$\Delta$
(eIF4G2 delete), and a \textit{GAP1} 5' UTR delete strain all
share a similar phenotype of lower \textit{GAP1} expression preceding
the upshift, and reduced decay upon the upshift. This suggests a
connection between translation initiation and mRNA level in different
environments of nitrogen availability, and that the destabilization 
phenomenon may in fact be the release of a stabilizing effect on these 
mRNA during growth in nitrogen limitation.
