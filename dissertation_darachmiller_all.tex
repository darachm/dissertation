A sailboat is an effective means of transiting the ocean. The
aim of the method is to use lines and fabric and structure to
place gradients against each other and give them the only option of
causing progress. 
A sailboat needs the wind as much as it needs the water,
for without a good keel there's little for the winds to push off of.
Without wind there's little action, and a tiller's important for
deciding where the action should proceed.
Many human endeavors can be described with 
this metaphor --- a variety of forces, pressures, opportunities, 
all swirling around to make something flow in a particular
direction. When all the components align with and against each
other in harmony, then all the components make the effect.
 
I would like to acknowledge the general environment that has been
built over these many years at NYU Biology. It is a unique moment of
growth where it's easy for most people to know most people and what
most people are up to. These informal linkages underline a surprising
amount of progress, opportunities, and growth. As Benjy Neymotin 
pointed out several years ago: "it takes a village", and lo there is a
village.
This particular moment of particular parameters will fade as the 
department grows, but I am confident that institutionalization of 
these collaborative and supportive networks will ensure continued 
success.

Specifically,
I would like to thank the kind folks on the 4th floor of CGSB, namely
the research group led by Christine Vogel, ?,

\section*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\numberline{}Abstract}

Cellular responses to changing environments frequently involve rapid
reprogramming of the transcriptome. Regulated
changes in mRNA degradation rates can accelerate reprogramming by
clearing or stabilizing extant transcripts. 
During a nitrogen upshift, the budding yeast \textit{Saccharomyces
cerevisiae} reprograms its physiology in order to enter into  
a state of rapid growth. 
I sought to understand the role of transcriptome reprogramming
in effecting this transition.
During the first minutes of a nitrogen upshift,
preceding the changes in population growth rate,
the transcriptome quickly into a state transiently distinct from
either rapid or slow growth.
During this, the five fastest decreasing mRNA are all NCR-regulated 
transporters, suggesting that this reprogramming is specifically
targeted to set the transcriptional program for rapid growth.
Many transcripts decrease significantly faster than expected from
their stability measured during steady-state growth during
rich media conditions, so I set out to determine the stability of
the yeast transcriptome preceding and during a nitrogen upshift.
I used 4-thiouracil labeling to track mRNA stability, and found 
that 78 mRNAs are subject to destabilization. 
These transcripts include
Nitrogen Catabolite Repression (NCR) and carbon metabolism mRNAs,
suggesting that mRNA destabilization is a mechanism for targeted
reprogramming. 
To explore the molecular basis of destabilization and possible
mechanisms of specifying or effecting the destabilization, I
developed a novel method combining mRNA FISH, fluorescence-activated
cell sorting, and DNA barcode sequencing to screen the pooled deletion
collection library for \textit{trans} factors that mediate rapid GAP1 mRNA
repression. This required that I completely redesign the methods for 
low-input multiplexed barcode sequencing, as well as adapt 
branched-DNA single-molecule mRNA FISH protocols to work in budding
yeast. Modeling of the data identifies known factors of mRNA
degradation, namely all three non-essential components of the
Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex, as being important for proper \textit{GAP1}
mRNA dynamics. However, the modulators \textit{EDC3} and \textit{SCD6}
have more complex phenotypes. Re-analyzing previously collected data,
I identified that a \textit{scd6}$\Delta$, \textit{tif4632}$\Delta$
(eIF4G2 knock-out), and a \textit{GAP1} 5' UTR delete strain all
share a similar phenotype of lower \textit{GAP1} expression preceding
the upshift, and reduced decay upon the upshift. This suggests that 
translation initiation dynamics may play a role in mRNA levels and 
their stability, and suggests that the destabilization phenomenon 
may in fact be the release of a stabilization effect.
