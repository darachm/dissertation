              for specific groups of transcripts and at the system-wide level.
              For example, acute glucose starvation induces global mRNA
              stabilization but increases the degradation of all 132 detected
              ribosomal protein mRNAs. This effect is transient and can be
              mimicked by inhibiting the target-of-rapamycin kinase. Half-lives
              of mRNAs critical for galactose (GAL) metabolism are also highly
              sensitive to changes in carbon source. The fast reduction of GAL

              and estimated the activation degrees of all identified
              nitrogen-responding transcriptional controls according to the

              fast growth and a highly active nitrogen catabolite repression
              (NCR) control. Catabolism of these compounds typically yields
              carbon derivatives directly assimilable by a cell's metabolism.
              Another group of nitrogen compounds supports slower growth, is
              associated with excretion by cells of nonmetabolizable carbon
              compounds such as fusel oils, and is characterized by activation
              of the general control of amino acid biosynthesis (GAAC).
              Furthermore, NCR and GAAC appear interlinked, since expression of
              the GCN4 gene encoding the transcription factor that mediates
              GAAC is subject to NCR. We also observed that several

              eukaryotic mRNA surveillance pathway tasked with the elimination
              of transcripts harboring an in-frame premature termination codon
              (PTC). As presently conceived, NMD acting in this manner
              minimizes the likelihood that potentially toxic polypeptide
              fragments would accumulate in the cytoplasm. This notion is to be
              contrasted to the results of systematic RNA-Seq and microarray
              analyses of NMD substrates in multiple model systems, two
              different experimental approaches which have shown that many
              mRNAs identified as NMD substrates fail to contain a PTC. Our
              recent results provide insight into, as well as a possible
              solution for, this conundrum. By high-resolution profiling of
              mRNAs that accumulate in yeast when the principal NMD regulatory
              genes (UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3) are deleted, we identified

              form a hetero-octameric complex together with the protein Pat1.
              The Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex plays a key role in mRNA decapping and

              the relationship between them shapes transcriptome kinetics.
              Specifically, when transcription changes are counter-acted with
              changes in mRNA stability, transient fast-relaxing transcriptome
              kinetics is observed. A possible molecular mechanism underlying
              such coordinated regulation might lay in two RNA polymerase (Pol
              II) subunits, Rpb4 and Rpb7, which are recruited to mRNAs during
              transcription and later affect their degradation in the
              cytoplasm. Here we used a yeast strain carrying a mutant Pol II

  abstract = "Recent experiments have shown that mRNAs can move between
              polysomes and P-bodies, which are aggregates of nontranslating
              mRNAs associated with translational repressors and the mRNA
              decapping machinery. The transitions between polysomes and
              P-bodies and how the poly(A) tail and the associated poly(A)
              binding protein 1 (Pab1p) may affect this process are unknown.
              Herein, we provide evidence that poly(A)(+) mRNAs can enter
              P-bodies in yeast. First, we show that both poly(A)(-) and
              poly(A)(+) mRNA become translationally repressed during glucose
              deprivation, where mRNAs accumulate in P-bodies. In addition,
              both poly(A)(+) transcripts and/or Pab1p can be detected in
              P-bodies during glucose deprivation and in stationary phase.
              Cells lacking Pab1p have enlarged P-bodies, suggesting that Pab1p
              plays a direct or indirect role in shifting the equilibrium of
              mRNAs away from P-bodies and into translation, perhaps by aiding
              in the assembly of a type of mRNP within P-bodies that is poised
              to reenter translation. Consistent with this latter possibility,
              we observed the translation initiation factors (eIF)4E and eIF4G
              in P-bodies at a low level during glucose deprivation and at high
              levels in stationary phase. Moreover, Pab1p exited P-bodies much
              faster than Dcp2p when stationary phase cells were given fresh
              nutrients. Together, these results suggest that polyadenylated

              poly(A)(+) mRNA, Pab1p, eIF4E, and eIF4G2 may represent a

              mechanism of suppressing fluconazole toxicity by repression of
              the ERG25 gene. Assessment of multiple target loci across
              treatments using gRNA libraries allows us to determine
              generalizable features associated with gRNA efficacy. Guides that
              target regions with low nucleosome occupancy and high chromatin
              accessibility are clearly more effective. We also find that the
              best region to target gRNAs is between the transcription start
              site (TSS) and 200 bp upstream of the TSS. Finally, unlike
              nuclease-proficient Cas9 in human cells, the specificity of
              truncated gRNAs (18 nt of complementarity to the target) is not
              clearly superior to full-length gRNAs (20 nt of complementarity),
              as truncated gRNAs are generally less potent against both
              mismatched and perfectly matched targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our
              results establish a powerful functional and chemical genomics
              screening method and provide guidelines for designing effective
              gRNAs, which consider chromatin state and position relative to
              the target gene TSS. These findings will enable effective library
              design and genome-wide programmable gene repression in many
              genetic backgrounds.",

              complex biochemical pathways for mRNA degradation have been
              identified. The central aim of this paper is to bring together
              both the experimental evidence about the decay patterns and the
              biochemical knowledge about the multi-step nature of mRNA
              degradation in a coherent mathematical theory. We first introduce
              a mathematical relationship between the mRNA decay pattern and
              the lifetime distribution of individual mRNA molecules. This
              relationship reveals that the mRNA decay patterns at steady state
              expression level must obey a general convexity condition, which
              applies to any degradation mechanism. Next, we develop a theory,
              formulated as a Markov chain model, that recapitulates some
              aspects of the multi-step nature of mRNA degradation. We apply
              our theory to experimental data for yeast and explicitly derive

              physiologically equivalent outcomes with respect to TorC1, i.e.
              its down-regulation as reflected by TorC1 reporter responses. We
              tested this assumption by performing head-to-head comparisons of

              for a downstream proxy of TorC1 inactivation, nuclear Gln3

              localization. Rapamycin treatment required Sit4 and PP2A.
              Nitrogen limitation and short-term nitrogen starvation required
              only Sit4. G1 arrest-correlated, long-term nitrogen starvation

              These data indicate that the five commonly used nitrogen-related

              equivalent and minimally involve partially differing regulatory

              driving mRNA toward the assembly of a decapping complex, leading
              to decapping. While mRNA stability decreases as a consequence of
              translational inhibition, in apparent contradiction several
              external stresses both inhibit translation initiation and
              stabilize mRNA. A key difference in these processes is that
              stresses induce multiple responses, one of which stabilizes mRNAs
              at the initial and rate-limiting step of general mRNA decay.
              Because this increase in mRNA stability is directly induced by
              stress, it is independent of the translational effects of stress,
              which provide the cell with an opportunity to assess its response
              to changing environmental conditions. After assessment, the cell
              can store mRNAs, reinitiate their translation or, alternatively,
              embark on a program of enhanced mRNA decay en masse. Finally,
              recent results suggest that mRNA decay is not limited to
              non-translating messages and can occur when ribosomes are not
              initiating but are still elongating on mRNA. This review will
              discuss the models for the mechanisms of these processes and
              recent developments in understanding the relationship between
              translation and general mRNA degradation, with a focus on yeast

              RGG-motif proteins in repressing translation initiation by
              binding eIF4G1. However the signaling mechanism(s) that leads to
              spatial and temporal regulation of repression activity of
              RGG-motif proteins remains unknown. Here we report the role of
              arginine methylation in regulation of repression activity of
              Scd6, a conserved RGG-motif protein. We demonstrate that Scd6
              gets arginine methylated at its RGG-motif and Hmt1 plays an
              important role in its methylation. We identify specific
              methylated arginine residues in the Scd6 RGG-motif in vivo We
              provide evidence that methylation augments Scd6 repression
              activity. Arginine methylation defective (AMD) mutant of Scd6
              rescues the growth defect caused by overexpression of Scd6, a
              feature of translation repressors in general. Live-cell imaging
              of the AMD mutant revealed that it is defective in inducing
              formation of stress granules. Live-cell imaging and pull-down
              results indicate that it fails to bind eIF4G1 efficiently.
              Consistent with these results, a strain lacking Hmt1 is also
              defective in Scd6-eIF4G1 interaction. Our results establish that
              arginine methylation augments Scd6 repression activity by
              promoting eIF4G1-binding. We propose that arginine methylation of

              Here we demonstrate that the sterile-alpha motif (SAM) domain of

              Residues that compose the RNA-binding surface are conserved in a

              require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a

              phases of the stress response. During the initial shock phase,
              mRNA synthesis and decay rates decrease globally, resulting in
              mRNA storage. During the subsequent induction phase, both rates

              decay rates are largely restored, whereas synthesis rates remain
              altered, apparently enabling growth at high salt concentration.

              which support growth. Using cloned genes for several S.
              cerevisiae ribosomal proteins, we found that the changes in the

              of the mRNA is due to a brief but severe inhibition of the

              the total transcription of mRNA in the cells is relatively

              termination promotes rapid degradation of mRNAs. Accelerated
              decay requires the presence of specific cis-acting sequences
              which have been defined as downstream elements. It has been
              proposed that the role of the downstream element may be to
              promote translational reinitiation or ribosomal pausing. The GCN4
              gene produces an mRNA that contains four short upstream open
              reading frames (uORFs) preceding the GCN4 protein-coding region
              in which translational initiation and reinitiation events occur.
              It was anticipated that these uORFs would function in a manner
              analogous to nonsense codons, promoting rapid degradation of the
              mRNA. However, the GCN4 transcript was not degraded by the
              nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. We have investigated the
              role of the leader region of the GCN4 transcript in an effort to
              identify possible sequence elements that inactivate this decay
              pathway. We show that the GCN4 leader region does not harbor a

              using hybrid GCN4-PGK1 transcripts, we demonstrate that if a
              translational reinitiation signal precedes a downstream element,
              the mRNA will no longer be sensitive to nonsense-mediated decay.
              Furthermore, we demonstrate that the downstream element is

              deadenylation followed by decapping and 5'-3' exonucleolytic

              work has shown that these empirical regularities can be derived
              from coarse-grained models of resource allocation. While these
              studies focus on steady-state growth, such conditions are rarely
              found in natural habitats, where microorganisms are continually
              challenged by environmental fluctuations. The aim of this paper
              is to extend the study of microbial growth strategies to
              dynamical environments, using a self-replicator model. We
              formulate dynamical growth maximization as an optimal control
              problem that can be solved using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle.
              We compare this theoretical gold standard with different possible
              implementations of growth control in bacterial cells. We find
              that simple control strategies enabling growth-rate maximization
              at steady state are suboptimal for transitions from one growth
              regime to another, for example when shifting bacterial cells to a
              medium supporting a higher growth rate. A near-optimal control
              strategy in dynamical conditions is shown to require information
              on several, rather than a single physiological variable.
              Interestingly, this strategy has structural analogies with the

              mechanisms as well as responsible factors for these processes are
              beginning to be understood. However, the initial processes for
              detecting stalled translation that result in degradation remain
              to be determined. Among the factors identified to date, two E3
              ubiquitin ligases have been reported to function in distinct
              manners. Because ubiquitination is one of the most versatile of
              cellular signals, these distinct functions of E3 ligases
              suggested diverse ubiquitination pathways during surveillance for
              stalled translation. In this study, we report experimental
              evidences for a unique role of non-proteasomal K63
              polyubiquitination during quality control for stalled
              translation. Inhibiting K63 polyubiquitination by expressing a

              markedly abolished the quality control responses for stalled

              K63R mutants were independent of the proteasome and that K63
              polyubiquitination is dependent on Hel2, one of the E3 ligases.
              Moreover, a K63R ubiquitin mutant barely inhibited the quality

              alanine scanning mutagenesis to create 31 mutant versions of the
              enzyme, and we examined the effects of the mutations both in vivo
              and in vitro. Two types of mutations that affected mRNA decapping
              in vivo were identified, including a temperature-sensitive
              allele. First, two mutants produced decapping enzymes that were
              defective for decapping in vitro, suggesting that these mutated
              residues are required for enzymatic activity. In contrast,
              several mutants that moderately affected mRNA decapping in vivo

              loss of function in vivo, but that still produced fully active
              enzymes in vitro. This suggested that interactions of the
              decapping enzyme with other factors may be required for efficient
              decapping in vivo, and that these particular mutations may be
              disrupting such interactions. Interestingly, partial loss of
              decapping activity in vivo led to a defect in normal
              deadenylation-dependent decapping, but it did not affect the

              shown that a nonubiquitinateable form of the permease,
              Gap1p(K9R,K16R), is constitutively localized to the plasma

              Gap1p(K9R,K16R) can be rapidly and reversibly inactivated at the

              Surprisingly, we also find that addition of most single amino
              acids is lethal to Gap1p(K9R,K16R)-expressing cells, whereas
              mixtures of amino acids are less toxic. This toxicity appears to

              of the marked variation in mRNA turnover, the total mRNA

              genes lowered mRNA levels by reducing mRNA stability or the

              pathway is decapping, since removal of the cap structure permits
              5'-->3' exonucleolytic digestion. Based on alterations in mRNA
              decay rate from strains deficient in translation initiation, it
              has been proposed that the decapping rate is modulated by a
              competition between the cytoplasmic cap binding complex, which
              promotes translation initiation, and the decapping enzyme, Dcp1p.
              In order to test this model directly, we examined the functional
              interaction of Dcp1p and the cap binding protein, eukaryotic
              translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), in vitro. These
              experiments indicated that eIF4E is an inhibitor of Dcp1p in
              vitro due to its ability to bind the 5' cap structure. In
              addition, we demonstrate that in vivo a temperature-sensitive
              allele of eIF4E (cdc33-42) suppressed the decapping defect of a
              partial loss-of-function allele of DCP1. These results argue that
              dissociation of eIF4E from the cap structure is required before
              decapping. Interestingly, the temperature-sensitive allele of
              eIF4E does not suppress the decapping defect seen in strains

              been identified, members of which contain the 'Sm' sequence
              motif, form a complex with U6 small nuclear RNA and are required
              for pre-mRNA splicing. Here we show that mutations in seven yeast
              Lsm proteins (Lsm1-Lsm7) also lead to inhibition of mRNA
              decapping. In addition, the Lsm1-Lsm7 proteins
              co-immunoprecipitate with the mRNA decapping enzyme (Dcp1), a
              decapping activator (Pat1/Mrt1) and with mRNA. This indicates
              that the Lsm proteins may promote decapping by interactions with
              the mRNA and the decapping machinery. In addition, the Lsm
              complex that functions in mRNA decay appears to be distinct from
              the U6-associated Lsm complex, indicating that Lsm proteins form
              specific complexes that affect different aspects of mRNA
              metabolism.",

              stability primarily by the inhibition of deadenylation. We
              previously demonstrated that mutations in decapping activators
              (edc3∆ lsm4∆C), which result in defects in P body assembly, can
              destabilize mRNA under unstressed conditions. We wished to
              examine whether mRNA would be destabilized in the edc3∆ lsm4∆C
              mutant as compared to the wild-type in response to osmotic
              stress, when P bodies are intense and numerous. Our results show
              that the edc3∆ lsm4∆C mutant limits the mRNA stability in
              response to osmotic stress, while the magnitude of stabilization
              was similar as compared to the wild-type. The reduced mRNA
              stability in the edc3∆ lsm4∆C mutant was correlated with a

              mechanisms that allow particular mRNAs to exhibit different rates
              of both deadenylation and decapping. Since the cap structure
              plays a critical role in the assembly of translation initiation
              factors, we hypothesized that the status of the cytoplasmic cap
              binding complex would affect the rate of decapping. To test this
              hypothesis, we examined mRNA decay rates in yeast strains that
              were defective in several translation initiation factors that are
              part of the cap binding complex. These experiments yielded three
              significant observations. First, any mutation known to inhibit

              Second, decapping still occurred only after deadenylation,

              decapping does not require efficient translation of the

              complex is a critical factor in determining the mRNA half-life.
              This view also implies that some cis-acting sequences that

              similar to those found when cells are exposed to different types
              of stress (>80\% overlap). Genes with decreased transcript levels
              in response to faster growth are largely of unknown function
              (>50\%) whereas genes with increased transcript levels are
              involved in macromolecular biosynthesis such as those that encode
              ribosomal proteins. This group also covers most targets of the
              transcriptional activator RAP1, which is also known to be
              involved in replication. A positive correlation between the
              location of replication origins and the location of
              growth-regulated genes suggests a role for replication in growth
              rate regulation. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the cellular
              growth rate has great influence on transcriptional regulation.
              This, in turn, implies that one should be cautious when comparing
              mutants with different growth rates. Our findings also indicate
              that much of the regulation is coordinated via the chromosomal
              location of the affected genes, which may be valuable information
              for the control of heterologous gene expression in metabolic
              engineering.",

              mechanism by which cell growth is regulated by nutrient
              availability in eukaryotes. We provide evidence that the TOR
              signaling pathway controls mRNA turnover in Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae. During nutrient limitation (diauxic shift) or after
              treatment with rapamycin (a specific inhibitor of TOR), multiple
              mRNAs were destabilized, whereas the decay of other mRNAs was
              unaffected. Our findings suggest that the regulation of mRNA
              decay by the TOR pathway may play a significant role in
              controlling gene expression in response to nutrient depletion.
              The inhibition of the TOR pathway accelerated the major mRNA
              decay mechanism in yeast, the deadenylation-dependent decapping
              pathway. Of the destabilized mRNAs, two different responses to
              rapamycin were observed. Some mRNAs were destabilized rapidly,
              while others were affected only after prolonged exposure. Our
              data suggest that the mRNAs that respond rapidly are destabilized
              because they have short poly(A) tails prematurely either as a
              result of rapid deadenylation or reduced polyadenylation. In
              contrast, the mRNAs that respond slowly are destabilized by rapid
              decapping. In summary, the control of mRNA turnover by the TOR
              pathway is complex in that it specifically regulates the decay of
              some mRNAs and not others and that it appears to control decay by

              the repression of a large number of genes when glucose is an
              abundant carbon source and almost all of the energy requirements
              of the cell can be satisfied from glycolysis. Prominent among the
              repressed genes are those encoding mitochondrial proteins
              required for respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. Past
              studies have characterized a pathway by which a signal generated
              from extracellular glucose is transmitted to the nucleus. The
              ultimate outcome is the repression of transcription of numerous
              genes, but also the induction of a limited number of others. The
              emphasis has been almost exclusively on transcriptional control
              mechanisms. A discovery made originally with the transcript of
              the SDH2 gene prompted an investigation of post-transcriptional
              mechanisms, and more specifically a study of the turnover rate of
              this mRNA in the absence and presence of glucose. SDH2 mRNA has a
              very short half-life in medium with glucose (YPD) and a
              significantly longer half-life in medium with glycerol (YPG).

              mRNA turnover in yeast and (2) initiation of translation on the

              with the following major features: the carbon source, via a
              signaling pathway involving kinase/phosphatase activities,
              controls the rate of initiation, and thus influences a
              competition between eukaryotic initiation factors (prominently
              eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF3) binding to the capped mRNA and a decapping
              activity (DCP1) which is one of the rate limiting activities in

              levels determine roughly 40\% of the variation in protein levels,
              indicating dominant post-transcriptional effects. However, the
              techniques underlying these conclusions, such as correlation and

              the vast landscape of RNA regulatory elements remains largely

              local RNA secondary structure to the definition of interaction
              partners in a variety of regulatory contexts, including--but not
              limited to--transcript stability, alternative splicing and
              localization. There are many documented instances where the
              presence of a structural regulatory element dictates alternative
              splicing patterns (for example, human cardiac troponin T) or
              affects other aspects of RNA biology. Thus, a full
              characterization of post-transcriptional regulatory programs
              requires capturing information provided by both local secondary
              structures and the underlying sequence. Here we present a

              regulator that binds this element and stabilizes a large number
              of its target genes. We created a global post-transcriptional
              regulatory map based on the identity of the discovered linear and
              structural cis-regulatory elements, their regulatory interactions
              and their target pathways. This approach could also be used to

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recent experiments have shown that codon optimality
              is a major determinant of mRNA stability in Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae and that this phenomenon may be conserved in
              Escherichia coli and some metazoans, although work in Neurospora
              crassa is not consistent with this model. RESULTS: We examined
              the association between codon optimality and mRNA stability in
              the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our analysis
              revealed the following points. First, we observe a genome-wide
              association between codon optimality and mRNA stability also in
              S. pombe, suggesting evolutionary conservation of the phenomenon.
              Second, in both S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, mRNA synthesis rates
              are also correlated at the genome-wide analysis with codon
              optimality, suggesting that the long-appreciated association
              between codon optimality and mRNA abundance is due to regulation
              of both mRNA synthesis and degradation. However, when we examined
              correlation of codon optimality and either mRNA half-lives or
              synthesis rates controlling for mRNA abundance, codon optimality
              was still positively correlated with mRNA half-lives in S.
              cerevisiae, but the association was no longer significant for
              mRNA half-lives in S. pombe or for synthesis rates in either
              organism. This illustrates how only the pairwise analysis of
              multiple correlating variables may limit these types of analyses.
              Finally, in S. pombe, codon optimality is associated with known
              DNA/RNA sequence motifs that are associated with mRNA
              production/stability, suggesting these two features have been
              under similar selective pressures for optimal gene expression.
              CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the emerging body of studies, this
              study suggests that the association between codon optimality and
              mRNA stability may be a broadly conserved phenomenon. It also
              suggests that the association can be explained at least in part
              by independent adaptations of codon optimality and other
              transcript features for elevated expression during evolution.",

              The cytoplasmic Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex is a conserved component of
              the 5'-to-3' mRNA decay pathway, linking deadenylation to
              decapping. Lsm1-7 is similar to the nuclear Sm complexes that
              bind oligo-uridine tracts in snRNAs. The 2.3 {\AA} resolution
              structure of S. cerevisiae Lsm1-7 shows the presence of a
              heptameric ring with Lsm1-2-3-6-5-7-4 topology. A distinct
              structural feature of the cytoplasmic Lsm ring is the C-terminal
              extension of Lsm1, which plugs the exit site of the central
              channel and approaches the RNA binding pockets. The 3.7 {\AA}
              resolution structure of Lsm1-7 bound to the C-terminal domain of
              Pat1 reveals that Pat1 recognition is not mediated by the
              distinguishing cytoplasmic subunit, Lsm1, but by Lsm2 and Lsm3.
              These results show how the auxiliary domains and the canonical Sm
              folds of the Lsm1-7 complex are organized in order to mediate and
              modulate macromolecular interactions.",

  author   = "Beck, T and Hall, M N",
  abstract = "The rapamycin-sensitive TOR signalling pathway in Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae activates a cell-growth program in response to
              nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon. The TOR1 and TOR2 kinases
              (TOR) control cytoplasmic protein synthesis and degradation
              through the conserved TAP42 protein. Upon phosphorylation by TOR,
              TAP42 binds and possibly inhibits type 2A and type-2A-related
              phosphatases; however, the mechanism by which TOR controls
              nuclear events such as global repression of starvation-specific
              transcription is unknown. Here we show that TOR prevents
              transcription of genes expressed upon nitrogen limitation by
              promoting the association of the GATA transcription factor GLN3
              with the cytoplasmic protein URE2. The binding of GLN3 to URE2
              requires TOR-dependent phosphorylation of GLN3. Phosphorylation
              and cytoplasmic retention of GLN3 are also dependent on the TOR
              effector TAP42, and are antagonized by the type-2A-related
              phosphatase SIT4. TOR inhibits expression of
              carbon-source-regulated genes by stimulating the binding of the
              transcriptional activators MSN2 and MSN4 to the cytoplasmic
              14-3-3 protein BMH2. Thus, the TOR signalling pathway broadly
              controls nutrient metabolism by sequestering several
              transcription factors in the cytoplasm.",
