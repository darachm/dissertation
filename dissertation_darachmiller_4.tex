 polyA probes - a control to an
orthogonal perspective on transcriptome scaling Rationale and prior
work Development Application to changes in growth rate, steady-state
and upshift Address limitations, possible future controls Stephen’s
heat shock screen Rationale and prior work Development The actual
experiment and results Interpretation Apparent cell-cycle halt upon
glutamine addition Previous work on cell cycle halt, basically just
alberghina, PKA and CLN1 This phenomenon has been previously seen.
Upshift ecoli, they get bigger.  This is thought to be because the
critical cell size threshold has been reset by growth signalling
pathways to a larger size. However, this result might argue that
instead it could be regulated by CLN1 transcript abundance.
Alberghina’s demonstrated that depends on Swi4?p, so there you go
Experiment, results Conclusion ( anything that didn’t get into chapter
3 )
